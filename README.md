# Container Workspaces

Simple Workspace Management Leveraging Firefox's Container Tabs

This extension brings focused organization to your Firefox experience by introducing workspaces that are linked to container tabs. Imagine having a dedicated workspace for your "Work" tabs, another for "Personal" browsing, and yet another for "Side Projects" â€“ all within the same Firefox window.

With Workspaces for Tab Containers, you can:

-   Isolate tabs by container: When you select a workspace, only the tabs belonging to its associated tab container type are visible in that window.
-   Maintain focus: Reduce distractions by hiding irrelevant tabs, allowing you to concentrate on the task at hand.
-   Window-specific workspaces: Each Firefox window can have a different workspace active, giving you ultimate flexibility in managing your browsing sessions.
-   Easy workspace switching: Simply open the extension's popup to quickly select the workspace you want to activate in the current window.

Stop searching through endless tabs! Container Workspaces provides a clean and efficient way to manage your different browsing contexts, helping you stay organized and productive.
